change in database.

booking table will not have b_from and b_to anymore.
it will be moved to booked table.


tried to move the booking_no generator at the bookingpage.php
currently the clear booking function is not working.
check the delete query for bookings in the clear bookings logic in booking3.php


booking_number stuck at being mysqli_result type.
Need to somehow get a string or integer out of it.
if fixed need to check other places for it.
right now just concerned with bookingpage.php and
finalizebooking.php
